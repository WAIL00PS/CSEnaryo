# CSEnaryo

**CSEnaryo** stands for *Civil Service Exam Senaryo* — a collection of possible scenarios and practice questions generated by AI.

This project is vibe-coded — I’m still trying to figure out how everything works.

Nothing's final yet.  
Still under development, still experimenting, still learning as I go.

Progress is slow but steady.  
Will update things little by little.
